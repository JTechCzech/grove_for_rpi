# Grove libraryes for Rpi
## Introduction
Maybe the Grove.py library for raspberry pi is broken too. Here are the working libraries for python on raspberry pi.
In this first (:D) GitHub repository you can find the patched libraries from the original raspberry pi python library Grove.py. More libraries will be added. Specifically, this repository will be related to the Grove Creator Kit - B (since it's the only grove kit I own). If you've installed the Grove.py library recently, you've probably encountered an error after running the setup.py program.
## How to import libraryes
To import the libraries into your project, place the .py file with the library next to your python project or create a custom package with init
and libraries.
## Transcription information
The libraries are rewritten with ChatGPT from working libraries on raspberry pico or arduino and tested by me (does not guarantee 100% reliability of the libraries.
